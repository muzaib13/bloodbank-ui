To Use Redux, we need to install 3 packages.
1. redux
2. react-redux --> Connet React with Redux. 
3. redux-thunk

Redux has 3 elements
1. action : Define what type of actions we have : CREATE,UPDATE,SELECT, DELETE etc 
2. reducer : action object will be passed to the reducer. In reducer we modify the data in the store. 
3. store : In Store, we put all the records in a state 


In Component -> we call dispatch(action) -> It will reach to reducer - > Base upon the action reducer will update the data in the store.



Create a store in actions folder
import the store in App.js
To implement store, we need to import Provider from react- redux



// MATERIAL-UI

1. We have to add container component from Material-UI. It defines how much space we want to use for app development from device display
